# InstaInfo

A project using Facebook for Developers' Instagram Graph API (more specifically features needed to use the hashtag search) coded in python. See [hashtagsearch.py](https://github.com/rvila08/instainfo/blob/master/hashtagsearch.py) and [info.py](https://github.com/rvila08/instainfo/blob/master/info.py) for this code. We also have an HTML page, [instainfo.html](https://github.com/rvila08/instainfo/blob/master/templates/instainfo.html) that implements Flask functionality to interact with the aforementioned python code. 

## Instructions for Implementation

* Clone into this repository
* Run the command 'python3 hashtagsearch.py'
  * This will open a Flask server on your local host
* Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/] (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to now see [instainfo.html](https://github.com/rvila08/instainfo/blob/master/templates/instainfo.html) in full effect
* One can know enter any hashtag into the text box and after submitting will be redirected to the most popular Instagram page containing that hashtag
