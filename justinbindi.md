My contributions to the project:

* I first created the Instagram Creator Account and Facebook for Developers project necessary to access the access tokens, ids, etc. needed to access the hashtag search functionality and data.
* I then implemented the code files necessary (hashtagsearch.py, info.py) that work to retreive the most popular post using a certain hashtag.
* I also edited the html file's form section to connect it to the python code.
* I also added the Dockerfile and requirements.txt so that the application can run in a Docker container.
